# The Inspiration Exchange AutoML Competition

This repository provides instructions for participants engaging in the *Inspiration Exchange AutoML Competition* organized by the [vanderschaar lab](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/engagement-sessions/). Participation in this competition is open for all attendees of the vanderschaar lab Inspiration Exchange (IE) sessions (Check this [link](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/engagement-sessions/) for more information on how to join). The competition will take place as part of the third IE session held by our lab. The deadline for submitting the deliverables of the competition is November 5 at 16:00 GMT. Below are the description of the competition and instructions on how to join. 

## Robustness of AutoML to dataset shifts

Generalization performance of machine learning models is significantly affected by distributional mismatches between training and testing data. The sources for these distributional shifts vary depending on the application: the process being modeled may change over time, or the source of the training data may not be representative of the environment in which a model would be deployed. Designing machine learning models that are robust to distributional shift, e.g., models that are trained to work well even if the distribution of testing data differs from training data, is a key objective in many applications. 

In the first [two IE sessions](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/engagement-sessions/inspiration-exchange/), we discussed various automated machine learning (AutoML) algorithms that our lab has developed over the past few years. These algorithms are designed to automate modeling choices for the data set at hand, but they assume that training and testing data come from the same distribution. *The goal of this competition is to modify and amend one of our AutoML algorithms so that it becomes robust to distributional shifts*. The algorithm involved in the competition is [AutoPrognosis](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/alaa18b/alaa18b-supp.pdf), a system that automates ML pipelines using an advanced Bayesian optimization technique. Prof. van der Schaar has given a number of talks explaining the operation of AutoPrognosis; check her [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1uEATa0qIo) at the Alan Turing Institute for more details.
