# The Inspiration Exchange AutoML Competition

This repository provides instructions for participants engaging in the *Inspiration Exchange AutoML Competition* organized by the [vanderschaar lab](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/engagement-sessions/). Participation in this competition is open for all attendees of the vanderschaar lab Inspiration Exchange (IE) sessions (Check this [link](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/engagement-sessions/) for more information on how to join). The competition will take place as part of the third IE session held by our lab. The deadline for submitting the deliverables of the competition is November 5 at 16:00 GMT. Below are the description of the competition and instructions on how to join. 

## Robustness of AutoML to dataset shifts

Generalization performance of machine learning models is significantly affected by distributional mismatches between training and testing data. The sources for these distributional shifts vary depending on the application: the process being modeled may change over time, or the source of the training data may not be representative of the environment in which a model would be deployed. Designing machine learning models that are robust to distributional shift, e.g., models that are trained to work well even if the distribution of testing data differs from training data, is a key objective in many applications.
